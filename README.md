# IntSet_DataStructure_Pogram
This program implements IntSet, a custom integer set class in C++. It stores distinct integers using a dynamic, resizable array, removing fixed-size limits. The class supports insertion, removal, membership tests, and equality checks, while managing memory with the copy constructor, destructor, and assignment operator.
